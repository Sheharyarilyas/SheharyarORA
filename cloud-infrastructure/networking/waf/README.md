# WAF Assets
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a regional-based and edge enforcement service that is attached to an enforcement point, such as a load balancer or a web application domain name. WAF protects applications from malicious and unwanted internet traffic. WAF can protect any internet facing endpoint, providing consistent rule enforcement across a customer's applications. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is primarily focused on the security of web applications and operates at the layer 7 (HTTP). A WAF sits between users and web applications to detect and block malicious requests and exploits of security flaws (insecure code) in the web application. WAF helps stop specific layer 7 attacks against the web application, whether itâ€™s an attempt to exploit vulnerable code-level vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
