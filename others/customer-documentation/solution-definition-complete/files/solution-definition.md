## Document Purpose

*Guide:*

*Describe the purpose of this document and the Oracle-specific terminology, specifically around 'Workload'.*

*Example:*

This document provides a high-level solution definition for the Oracle solution and aims at describing the current state, and to-be state as well as a potential high-level project scope and timeline for \<Service Provider\>.

The document may refer to a ‘Workload’, which summarizes the full technical solution for a customer (You) during a single engagement. The Workload is described in the chapter [Workload Requirements and Architecture](#workload-requirements-and-architecture).

This is a living document, additional sections will be added as the engagement progresses resulting in a final Document to be handed over to the \<Service Provider\>.

# Business Context

*Guide:*

*Describe the customer's business and background. What is the context of the customer's industry and LoB? What are the business needs and goals that this Workload is an enabler for? How does this technical solution impact and support the customer's business goals? Does this solution support a specific customer strategy, or maybe certain customer values? How does this solution help our customers to either generate more revenue or save costs?*

## Executive Summary

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Oracle differentiator and key values of the solution of our solution for the customer, allowing the customer to make decisions quickly.*

## Workload Business Value

*Guide:*

*A clear statement of specific business value as part of the full workload scope. Try to keep it SMART: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-Related - Agree on the business value with the customer. Keep it business-focused, and speak the language of the LoB which benefits from this Workload: "Increase Customer Retention by 3% in the next year" or "Grow Customer Base with Executive Decision-Making from our Sales and Support Data". Avoid technical success criteria such as "Migrate App X to Oracle Cloud" or "Provision 5 Compute Instances". Avoid Oracle success criteria and language "Get Workload Consuming on OCI".*

# Workload Requirements and Architecture

## Overview

*Guide:*

*Describe the Workload: What applications and environments are part of this Workload migration or new implementation project, and what are their names? The implementation will be scoped later and can be a subset of the Solution Definition and proposed overall solution. For example, a Workload could exist of two applications, but the implementer would only include one environment of one application. The workload chapter is about the whole Workload and the implementation scope will be described later in the chapter [Solution Scope](#solution-scope).*

## Functional Requirements (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Provide a brief overview of the functional requirements, the functional area they belong to, the impacted business processes, etc.*

*Provide a formal description of the requirements as 1. a set of Use Cases or 2. a description of Functional Capabilities or 3. a Requirement Matrix. The three descriptions are not mutually exclusive.*

*Some Workload teams, especially the Analytics and Merging Tech teams, will create new applications based on functional requirements, some Workload teams will not touch the functional requirements at all and just change the platform under an application. However, it is important to understand who is using the system and for what reason.*

### Use Cases (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A Use Case (UC) can be represented in a table as the following one. See https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/use-case/what-is-use-case-specification/ for a quick introduction to the concept of UC. See https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/use-cases.html for more examples and detailed instructions.*

| Use Case Overview  | It is Wednesday and there is laundry in the laundry room. The housekeeper sorts it, then proceeds to launder each load. The housekeeper folds the dry laundry as he/she removes it from the dryer. The housekeeper irons those items that need ironing.                                                                                                          |
| Precondition 1     | It is Wednesday                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Trigger            | Dirty laundry is transported to the laundry room on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Basic Flow         | On Wednesdays, the housekeeper reports to the laundry room. The housekeeper sorts the laundry that is there. Then he/she washes each load. The housekeeper dries each load. He/She folds the items that need folding. He/She irons and hangs the wrinkled items. The housekeeper throws away any laundry item that is irrevocably shrunken, soiled, or scorched. |
| Alternative Flow 1 | If he/she notices that something is wrinkled, he/she irons it and then hangs it on a hanger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Alternative Flow 2 | If he/she notices that something is still dirty, he/she rewashes it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Alternative Flow 3 | If he/she notices that something shrank, he/she throws it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Functional Capabilities (Optional)

*Guide:*

*In specific cases, a set of Functional Capabilities can be represented in a functional decomposition diagram. This is typical of functional analysis in the System Engineering domain. For more information on Functional Analysis see, e.g. https://spacese.spacegrant.org/functional-analysis/.*

### Requirement Matrix (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A Requirement Matrix can be used when the solution will be based on software capabilities already available in existing components (either custom or vendor-provided). The Requirements Matrix is a matrix that is used to capture client requirements for software selection and to evaluate the initial functional “fit” of a vendor’s software solution to the business needs of the client.*

*Example:*

For example, rows can list required functional capabilities and columns can list available software components. Cells can contain a simple Y/N or provide more detail. The Requirements Matrix also is used to identify initial functional gaps or special software enhancements needed to enable each vendor’s software to fulfill the client’s desired system capabilities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

*Guide:*

*Describe the high-level technical requirements for the Workload. Consider all sub-chapters, but decide and choose which Non-Functional Requirements are necessary for your engagement. You might not need to capture all requirements for all sub-chapters.*

*This chapter is for describing customer-specific requirements (needs), not to explain Oracle solutions or capabilities.*

### Regulations and Compliances Requirements

*Guide:*

*This section captures specific regulatory or compliance requirements for the Workload. These may limit the types of technologies that can be used and may drive some architectural decisions.*

*The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compliance Documents service lets you view and download compliance documents: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ComplianceDocuments/Concepts/compliancedocsoverview.htm*

*If there are none, then please state it. Leave the second sentence as a default in the document.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Regulatory and Compliance requirements have been specified.

In addition to these requirements, the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundation Benchmark, v1.2](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/Oracle_Cloud) will be applied to the Customer tenancy.

### Environments

*Guide:*

*A diagram or list detailing all the required environments (e.g. development, text, live, production, etc.).*

*If you like to describe a current state, you can use or add the chapter 'Current Sate Architecture' before the 'Future State Architecture'.*

Example:

| Name       | Size of Prod | Location | DR  | Scope                           |
|:-----------|:-------------|:---------|:----|:--------------------------------|
| Production | 100%         | Malaga   | Yes | Not in Scope / On-prem          |
| DR         | 50%          | Sevilla  | No  | Workload                        |
| Dev & Test | 25%          | Sevilla  | No  | Workload - \<Service Provider\> |

### High Availability and Disaster Recovery Requirements

*Guide:*

*This section captures the resilience and recovery requirements for the Workload. Note that these may be different from the current system.*

*The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirement of each environment should be captured in the environments section above, and wherever possible.*

-   *What are the RTO and RPO requirements of the Application?*
-   *What are the SLAs of the application?*
-   *What are the backup requirements*

*Note that if needed, this section may also include an overview of the proposed backup and disaster recovery proposed architectures.*

*This chapter is mandatory, while there could be no requirements on HA/DR, please mention that in a short single sentence.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Resilience or Recovery requirements have been specified.

#### High Availability (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A subsubsection, if cleaner separation of Resilience and Recovery into HA, DR, and Backup and Restore is needed.*

| DWH          | BckpTime (F) | hours | 4     |
| DWH          | BckpTime (I) | hours | 1     |

### Security Requirements

*Guide:*

*Capture the Non-Functional Requirements for security-related topics. The requirements can be (but don't have to be) separated into:*

-   *Identity and Access Management*
-   *Data Security*

*Other security topics, such as network security, application security, key management, or others can be added if needed.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Security requirements have been specified.

#### Identity and Access Management (Optional)

*Guide:*

*The requirements for identity and access control. This section describes any requirements for authentication, identity management, single-sign-on, and necessary integrations to retained customer systems (e.g. corporate directories).*

-   *Is there any Single Sign On or Active Directory Integration Requirement?*
-   *Is the OS hardened if so please share the hardening guideline.*

#### Data Security (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Capture any specific or special requirements for data security. This section should also describe any additional constraints such as a requirement for data to be held in a specific location or for data export restrictions.*

### Networking Requirements

*Guide*

*This section should detail the requirements for the development and deployment lifecycle across the Workload. This details how code will be deployed and how consistency across the environments will be maintained over future software deployment. This may include a need for CI/CD.*

-   *Will a CI/CD tool need access to deploy to the target environment*
-   *Does the customer require software to be delivered to a repository*
-   *How will configuration and software be promoted through the environments*

### Operating Model (Optional)

*Guide:*

*This section captures requirements on how the system will be managed after implementation and migration. In the vast majority of cases, the solution will be handed back to the customer (or the customer's SI/partner), but in some cases, Oracle may also take on some sustaining responsibilities through ACS or OC.*

*Also, capture requirements for tools to monitor and manage the solution.*

### Management and Monitoring (Optional)

*Guide:*

*This subsection captures any requirements for integrations into the customer's existing management and monitoring systems - e.g. system monitoring, systems management, etc. Also, if the customer requires new management or monitor capabilities, these should be recorded.*

*Example:*

| Tool               | Task                   | Target         | Location        | New | Notes |

| Enterprise Manager | Manage DB Instances    | All Oracle DBs | OCI (Migration) | No  |       |

### Performance (Optional)

*Guide:*

*The performance requirements cover all aspects related to the time required to perform a given operation. They can be measured in different ways, for example: (1) AvrgTime: average response time that can be accepted for a given online or real interaction (data retrieve, data insert, etc.) (2) MaxTime: maximum response time for the same operations defined for AvrgRtime The operations can be online (user interactions), offline (batch execution) or (near)realtime (messaging).*

*Example:*

| Type     | Operation              | KPI                  | Unit     | Value | Notes |
|:---------|:-----------------------|:---------------------|:---------|:------|:------|
| Online   | Retrieve customer data | MaxTime              | sec      | 3     |       |
| Online   | Retrieve customer data | AvrgTime             | sec      | 0.2   |       |
| Realtime |                        | Receive MQTT message | AvrgTime | msec  | 100   |

### Capacity (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Capacity is a measure of the total workload the system can bear without affecting performance. There are many KPIs to measure capacity, depending on the system's functionalities. Some of the most relevant KPIs are:*

-   *MaxVol: maximum volume of data that can be stored in the system (can be different for different types of data, e.g. relational and file): 800-900GB current database size (probably with a significant waste of space)*
-   *MaxFlow: maximum data flow (input/output) that can be managed by the system (can be two different numbers for each major system interface and/or operation): the current value has not been measured but is expected to be at most a few GB.*
-   *MaxUser: maximum number of concurrent users (can be differentiated by user profile): up to 10 (number of registered users).*

*Example:*

| System     | Capacity               | KPI      | Unit | Value | Notes |
|:-----------|:-----------------------|:---------|:-----|:------|:------|
| DB server  | DB size                | MaxVol   | GB   | 2000  |       |
| ETL Server | Data processed nightly | MaxFlow  | GB/h | 100   |       |
| OAC Server | Simultaneous users     | MaxUsers | \-   | 10    |       |

## Constraints and Risks (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Constraints are limitations that will impact the resulting project or Solution Architecture. It is a technology- or project-related condition or event that prevents the project from fully delivering the ideal solution to customers and end-users. Constraints can be identified on our customer, partner, or even Oracle's side.*

*A project risk is an uncertain event that may or may not occur during a project.*

*Describe constraints and risks affecting the Workload and possible Logical Solution Architecture. These can be technical, but might also be non-technical. Consider budgets, timing, preferred technologies, skills in the customer organization, location, etc.*

*Example:*

| Name               | Description                                                              | Type       | Impact             | Mitigation Approach                                   |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:-------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| OCI skills         | Limited OCI skills in customers organization                             | Risk       | No Operating Model | Involve Ops partner, for example, Oracle ACS          |
| Team Availability  | A certain person is only available on Friday CET time zone               | Constraint |                    | Arrange meetings to fit that person's availability    |
| Access Restriction | We are not allowed to access a certain tenancy without customer presence | Constraint |                    | Invite customer key person to implementation sessions |

## Current State Architecture (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Provide a high-level logical description of the Workload's current state. Stay in the Workload scope, and show potential integrations, but do not try to create a full customer landscape. Use architecture diagrams to visualize the current state. I recommend not putting lists of technical resources or dependencies here. Refer to the attachments instead.*

## Future State Architecture

*Guide:*

*The Workload Future State Architecture can be described in various forms. In the easiest case, we describe a Logical Architecture, possibly with a System Context Diagram. A high-level physical architecture is mandatory as a description of your solution.*

*This should be the final architecture as part of the pre-sales solution, not an intermediate or draft version*

*Additional architectures, in the subsections, can be used to describe needs for specific workloads.*

### Mandatory Security Best Practices

*Guide:*

*Use this text for every engagement. Do not change. Aligned with the Cloud Adoption Framework*

The safety of the \<Customer Name\>'s Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) environment and data is the \<Customer Name\>’s priority.

To following table of OCI Security Best Practices lists the recommended topics to provide a secure foundation for every OCI implementation. It applies to new and existing tenancies and should be implemented before the Workload defined in this document will be implemented.

Workload-related security requirements and settings like tenancy structure, groups, and permissions are defined in the respective chapters.

Any deviations from these recommendations needed for the scope of this document will be documented in the chapters below. They must be approved by \<Customer Name\>.

\<Customer Name\> is responsible for implementing, managing, and maintaining all listed topics.

### OCI Secure Landing Zone Architecture

*Guide:*

*This chapter describes landing zone best practices and usually does not require any changes. If changes are required please refer to [Landing Zone GitHub](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/landing-zones). The full landing zone needs to be described in the Solution Design by the service provider.*

*Use this template ONLY for new cloud deployments and remove it for brownfield deployments.*

The design considerations for an OCI Cloud Landing Zone have to do with OCI and industry architecture best practices, along with \<Customer Name\> specific architecture requirements that reflect the Cloud Strategy (hybrid, multi-cloud, etc.). An OCI Cloud Landing zone involves a variety of fundamental aspects that have a broad level of sophistication. A good summary of a Cloud Landing Zone has been published in the [OCI User Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/landing-zone.htm).

#### Naming Convention

A naming convention is an important part of any deployment to ensure consistency as well as security within your tenancy. Hence we jointly agree on a naming convention, that matches Oracle's best practices and \<Customer Name\> requirements.

Oracle recommends the following Resource Naming Convention:

-   The name segments are separated by “-“
-   Within a name segment avoid using `<space>`{=html} and “.”
-   Where possible intuitive/standard abbreviations should be considered (e.g. “shared“ compared to "shared.cloud.team”)
-   When referring to the compartment full path, use “:” as a separator, e.g. cmp-shared:cmp-security

Some examples of naming are given below:

-   cmp-shared
-   cmp-\<workload\>
-   cmp-networking

The patterns used are these:

-   \<resource-type\>-\<environment\>-\<location\>-\<purpose\>
-   \<resource-type\>-\<environment\>-\<source-location\>-\<destination-location\>-\<purpose\>
-   \<resource-type\>-\<entity/sub-entity\>-\<environment\>-\<function/department\>-\<project\>-\<custom\>
-   \<resource-type\>-\<environment\>-\<location\>-\<purpose\>

Abbreviations per resource type are listed below. This list may not be complete.

| Resource Type                      | Abbreviation       | Example                                                     |

#### Security and Identity Management

This chapter covers the Security and Identity Management definitions and resources that will be implemented for \<Customer Name\>.

##### Universal Security and Identity and Access Management Principles

-   Groups will be configured at the tenancy level and access will be governed by policies configured in OCI.
-   Any new project deployment in OCI will start with the creation of a new compartment. Compartments follow a hierarchy, and the compartment structure will be decided as per the application requirements.
-   It is also proposed to keep any shared resources, such as Object Storage, Networks, etc. in a shared services compartment. This will allow the various resources in different compartments to access and use the resources deployed in the shared services compartment and user access can be controlled by policies related to specific resource types and user roles.
-   Policies will be configured in OCI to maintain the level of access/control that should exist between resources in different compartments. These will also control user access to the various resources deployed in the tenancy.
-   The tenancy will include a pre-provisioned Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) instance (the primary IDCS instance) or, where applicable, the Default Identity Domain. Both provide access management across all Oracle cloud services for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS cloud offerings.
-   The primary IDCS or the Default Identity Domain will be used as the access management system for all users administrating (OCI Administrators) the OCI tenant.

##### Authentication and Authorization for OCI

The provisioning of respective OCI administration users will be handled by \<Customer Name\>.

###### User Management

Only OCI Administrators are granted access to the OCI Infrastructure. As a good practice, these users are managed within the pre-provisioned and pre-integrated Oracle Identity Cloud Service (primary IDCS) or, where applicable, the OCI Default Identity Domain, of OCI tenancy. These users are members of groups. IDCS Groups can be mapped to OCI groups while Identity Domains groups do not require any mapping. Each mapped group membership will be considered during login.

**Local Users**

The usage of OCI Local Users is not recommended for the majority of users and is restricted to a few users only. These users include the initial OCI Administrator created during the tenancy setup and additional emergency administrators.

**Local Users are considered Emergency Administrators and should not be used for daily administration activities!**

**No additional users are to be, nor should be, configured as local users.**

**\<Customer Name\> is responsible to manage and maintain local users for emergency use cases.**

**Federated Users**

Unlike Local Users, Federated Users are managed in the Federated or Enterprise User Management system. In the OCI User list Federated Users may be distinguished by a prefix that consists of the name of the federated service in lower case, a '/' character followed by the user name of the federated user, for example:

`oracleidentityservicecloud/user@example.com`

Providing the same attributes (OCI API Keys, Auth Tokens, Customer Secret Keys, OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials, and SMTP Credentials) for Local and *Federated Users* federation with third-party Identity Providers should only be done in the pre-configured primary IDCS or the Default Identity Domain where applicable.

All users have the same OCI-specific attributes (OCI API Keys, Auth Tokens, Customer Secret Keys, OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials, and SMTP Credentials).

OCI Administration users should only be configured in the pre-configured primary IDCS or the Default Identity Domain where applicable.

**Note:** Any federated user can be a member of 100 groups only. The OCI Console limits the number of groups in a SAML assertion to 100 groups. User Management in the Enterprise Identity Management system will be handled by \<Customer Name\>.

**Authorization**

In general, policies hold permissions granted to groups. Policy and Group naming follows the Resource Naming Conventions.

**Tenant Level Authorization**

The policies and groups defined at the tenant level will provide access to administrators and authorized users, to manage or view resources across the entire tenancy. The tenant-level authorization will be granted to tenant administrators only.

These policies follow the recommendations of the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark v1.2.0, recommendations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

**Service Policy**

A Service Policy is used to enable services at the tenancy level. It is not assigned to any group.

**Shared Compartment Authorization**

Compartment-level authorization for the cmp-shared compartment structure uses the following specific policies and groups.

Apart from tenant-level authorization, authorization for the cmp-shared compartment provides specific policies and groups. In general, policies will be designed so that lower-level compartments are not able to modify the resources of higher-level compartments.

Policies for the cmp-shared compartment follow the recommendations of the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark v1.2.0, recommendations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

**Compartment Level Authorization**

Apart from tenant-level authorization, compartment-level authorization provides compartment structure-specific policies and groups. In general, policies will be designed so that lower-level compartments are not able to modify the resources of higher-level compartments.

**Authentication and Authorization for Applications and Databases**

Application (including Compute Instances) and Database User management are completely separate and done outside of the primary IDCS or Default Identity Domain. The management of these users is the sole responsibility of \<Customer Name\> using the application, compute instance, and database-specific authorization.

##### Security Posture Management

**Oracle Cloud Guard**

Oracle Cloud Guard Service will be enabled using the pcy-service policy and with the following default configuration. Customization of the Detector and Responder Recipes will result in clones of the default (Oracle Managed) recipes.

Cloud Guard default configuration provides a number of good settings. It is expected that these settings may not match \<Customer Name\>'s requirements.

**Targets**

In accordance with the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.2.0, Chapter 3.15](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks), Cloud Guard will be enabled in the root compartment.

**Detectors**

The Oracle Default Configuration Detector Recipes and Oracle Default Activity Detector Recipes are implemented. To better meet the requirements, the default detectors must be cloned and configured by \<Customer Name\>.

**Responder Rules**

The default Cloud Guard Responders will be implemented. To better meet the requirements, the default detectors must be cloned and configured by \<Customer Name\>.

**Vulnerability Scanning Service**

In accordance with the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.2.0, OCI Vulnerability Scanning](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) will be enabled using the pcy-service policy.

Compute instances that should be scanned *must* implement the *Oracle Cloud Agent* and enable the *Vulnerability Scanning plugin*.

**OCI OS Management Service**

Required policy statements for OCI OS Management Service are included in the pcy-service policy.

By default, the *OS Management Service Agent plugin* of the *Oracle Cloud Agent* is enabled and running on current Oracle Linux 6, 7, 8, and 9 platform images.

##### Monitoring, Auditing, and Logging

In accordance with the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.2.0, Chapter 3 Logging and Monitoring](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) the following configurations will be made:

-   OCI Audit log retention period set to 365 days.
-   At least one notification topic and subscription to receive monitoring alerts.
-   Notification for Identity Provider changes.
-   Notification for IdP group mapping changes.
-   Notification for IAM policy changes.
-   Notification for IAM group changes.
-   Notification for user changes.
-   Notification for VCN changes.
-   Notification for changes to route tables.
-   Notification for security list changes.
-   Notification for network security group changes.
-   Notification for changes to network gateways.
-   VCN flow logging for all subnets.
-   Write level logging for all Object Storage Buckets.
-   Notification for Cloud Guard detected problems.
-   Notification for Cloud Guard remedied problems.

For IDCS or OCI Identity Domain Auditing events, the respective Auditing API can be used to retrieve all required information.

##### Data Encryption

All data will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Encryption keys can be managed by Oracle or the customer and will be implemented for identified resources.

###### Key Management

All keys for **OCI Block Volume**, **OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes**, **OCI Database**, **OCI File Storage**, **OCI Object Storage**, and **OCI Streaming** are centrally managed in a shared or a private virtual vault will be implemented and placed in the compartment cmp-security.

**Object Storage Security**

For Object Storage security the following guidelines are considered.

-   **Access to Buckets** -- Assign least privileged access for IAM users and groups to resource types in the object-family (Object Storage Buckets & Object)
-   **Encryption at rest** -- All data in the Object Storage is encrypted at rest using AES-256 and is on by default. This cannot be turned off and objects are encrypted with a master encryption key.

**Data Residency**

It is expected that data will be held in the respective region and additional steps will be taken when exporting the data to other regions to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. This should be reviewed for every project onboard into the tenancy.

##### Operational Security

**Security Zones**

Whenever possible OCI Security Zones will be used to implement a security compartment for Compute instances or Database resources. For more information on Security Zones refer to the *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure User Guide* chapter on [Security Zones](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/security-zone/using/security-zones.htm).

**Remote Access to Compute Instances or Private Database Endpoints**

To allow remote access to Compute Instances or Private Database Endpoints, the OCI Bastion will be implemented for defined compartments.

To be able to use OCI services for OS management, Vulnerability Scanning, Bastion Service, etc. it is highly recommended to implement the Oracle Cloud Agent as documented in the *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure User Guide* chapter [Managing Plugins with Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm).

##### Network Time Protocol Configuration for Compute Instance

Synchronized clocks are a necessity for securely operating environments. OCI provides a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server using the OCI global IP number 169.254.169.254. All compute instances should be configured to use this NTP service.

##### Regulations and Compliance

\<Customer Name\> is responsible for setting the access rules to services and environments that require stakeholders’ integration into the tenancy to comply with all applicable regulations. Oracle will support in accomplishing this task.

## Roadmap (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Explain a high-level roadmap for this Workload. Include a few easy high-level steps to success (See Business Context). Include implementation services (if possible) as a first fast step. Add other implementation partners and their work as part of your roadmap as well. Do not include details about the implementation scope or timeline. This is not about product roadmaps.*

## Sizing and Bill of Materials

*Guide:*

*Estimate and size the physically needed resources of the Workload. The information can be collected and is based upon previously gathered capacities, business user numbers, integration points, or translated existing on-premises resources. The sizing is possibly done with or even without a Physical Architecture. It is okay to make assumptions and to clearly state them!*

*Clarify with sales your assumptions and your sizing. Get your sales to finalize the BoM with discounts or other sales calculations. Review the final BoM and ensure the sales are using the correct product SKUs / Part Number.*

*Even if the BoM and sizing were done with the help of Excel between the different teams, ensure that this chapter includes or links to the final BoM as well.*

*WIP*

-   *Revision of existing discovery templates*
-   *Consolidated data gathering sheet (sizing focused)*
-   *Workload-specific sizing process/methodology*

# Project Implementation (Only for Oracle Implementations!)

## Solution Scope

### Disclaimer

*Guide:*

*A scope disclaimer should limit scope changes and create awareness that a change of scope needs to be agreed upon by both parties.*

*Example:*

As part of the Oracle \<Service Provider\> Project, any scope needs to be agreed upon by both the customer and Oracle. A scope can change but must be confirmed again by both parties. Oracle can reject scope changes for any reason and may only design and implement a previously agreed scope. A change of scope can change any previously agreed milestone and needs to be technically feasible.

All items not explicitly stated to be within the scope of the \<Service Provider\> project will be considered out of scope. Oracle recommends the use of professional services to implement extensions or customizations beyond the original scope, as well as to operate the solution, with an Oracle-certified partner.

### Overview

*Guide:*

*Describe the scope of the implementation as a sub-set of the Workload scope. For example one environment from one application.*

*Example:*

-   Design and configure “least privilege” access controls and enable user access using OCI IAM compartments, groups, and policies.
-   Design and provide a secure, scalable OCI network architecture.

### Business Value

*Guide:*

*What's the value for the customer to do an Oracle implementation? For example, speed of deployment and the resulting impact on time to market, and free service. Do not describe Oracle's value or consumption.*

*Example:*

The Oracle \<Service Provider\> service brings several benefits to this project. All the activities mentioned within the scope will ensure the deployment of workload as per Oracle's best practices. As a tried and tested methodology by many customers, Oracle \<Service Provider\> brings the speed of deployment resulting in successful projects without any setbacks. Oracle \<Service Provider\> services will bring value to the overall project provisioning OCI environments for the application workload.

Oracle Cloud \<Service Provider\> services provide guidance from cloud engineers and project managers on planning, project management, architecting, deploying, and managing cloud migrations.

### Success Criteria

*Guide:*

*Technical success criteria for the implementation. As always be S.M.A.R.T: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timebound. Example: 'Deployment of all OCI resources for the scoped environments in 3 months'.*

*Example:*

The below-listed success criteria are for the \<Service Provider\> implementation only. Partner activities and success criteria are not listed in this documentation.

-   Finish provisioning of all OCI resources
-   Establish all required network connectivity
-   Successfully pass all test cases
-   Finished handover with documentation
-   Complete the Implementation Security Checklist

### Specific Requirements and Constraints (Optional)

*Guide:*

*If the implementation scope has special or different requirements as otherwise explained in the Workload.*

## Workplan

### Deliverables

*Guide:*

*Describe deliverables within the implementation scope. Including this documentation as Solution Definition and the later following Solution Design. This should be a generic reusable text, provided by the implementers.*

### Included Activities

*Guide:*

*Describe the implementation activities in detail. It does not need to include a list of cloud services or OCI capabilities, but rather includes activities such as 'Provisioning of Infrastructure Components'. Include scope boundaries in terms of the number of environments, resource count to be provisioned, data volume to be migrated, etc.*

*Example:* The implementation scope of work includes the following activities:

**OCI Foundation & Network**

-   OCI Foundation Setup - 1 Region (REGION NAME)
-   OCI Networking configuration
    -   Creation of VCN for up to 3 environments (up to 12 VCNs total)
    -   DRG and inter-VCN routing
    -   Deployment of standard Security lists and NSG in VCN
    -   Deployment of Route Tables in VCNs
-   Configure one site-to-site IPSec VPN between OCI & on-premises
-   Configure Web Application Firewall to route the incoming internet traffic to Load Balancers and configure recommended rules
-   Configure bastion service to allow admin users to connect to the tenancy through the internet access

**Security**

-   Enable Cloud Guard
-   Enable Datasafe and Register the Databases in scope
-   Enable VSS
-   Configure OCI IAM Domains

**Database**

-   Migrate one non-prod database with one iteration
-   Migrate one prod database with two iterations

### Recommended Activities

*Guide:*

*All activities not stated in the [Included Activities](#included-activities) are out of scope, as described in the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer). We do not provide a list of excluded activities to not create expectations based on a grey area between included and excluded activities. Here we only recommend further activities that happen to not be included but are not a full list of excluded activities.*

*Example:*

All items not explicitly stated to be within the scope of the implementation project will be considered out of scope. Oracle recommends the use of professional services to implement extensions or customizations beyond the original scope, or to operate the solution with any of Oracle's certified partners. As a part of this engagement, the below activities are considered to be out of implementation scope.

-   Any activities at customer on-premises or existing data center e.g. patching & backups required for migration
-   Any integration with other products than in scope
-   Any backup and recovery strategy implementation including third-party backup tool implementation
-   Application upgrade of any Oracle or other vendor or open source software.
-   SSL certificate management and configuration
-   Any form of testing and validations, including but not limited to performance testing, load testing, HA testing, DR testing, and tuning of any component in the solution
-   Any vulnerability assessment and penetration testing including server hardening, audit certification implementation
-   Any functional testing is to be conducted by the customer and/or third party involved
-   Any third-party firewall implementation, security tools, monitoring tools implementation
-   Troubleshooting existing open issues, including the performance of the application
-   Training on deployed products and OCI services
-   Run and maintain the support of the environment and end-user training

### Timeline

*Guide:*

*Provide a high-level implementation plan. Use phases to communicate an iterative implementation if needed. Include prerequisites in the plan*

#### Phase 1: `<Name>`{=html}

#### Phase n: `<name>`{=html}

### Implementation RACI

*Guide:*

*Describe for all activities the RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consultant, Informed) matrix*

*Example:*

### Transition Plan

*Guide:*

*The Transition Plan describes the handover of the project, after the implementation. Please ensure the accepting transition party is filled out.*

#### Introduction

Following the deployment of the solution to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure by the \<Service Provider\> team, it is important to ensure a smooth handover to a technical team, or a partner. \<Service Provider\> values the continuation of the cloud journey and we focus our efforts to ensure you start with the best possible foundation, to set you up for success in OCI.

When \<Service Provider\> completes the deliverables as described in the [Workplan](#workplan) section of this document, \<Service Provider\> will hand over the controls of the new OCI environment.

\<Customer Name\>, or a partner of your choice, will assume the ownership of the OCI tenancy and responsibility for further development of the OCI environment. From that moment forward, having completed the [Solution Scope](#solution-scope), \<Service Provider\> will disengage. For post-implementation support, Oracle provides you with three distinct resources:

1.  Oracle Account Cloud Engineer (ACE) – This is your first point of contact and will provide technical leadership and support for Oracle cloud technologies and your cloud transformation.
2.  Cloud Adoption Manager (CAM) - Introduces and plans operation monitoring and optimization advisory activities, and continues working with you on the next milestones. Please contact your ACE for further information.
3.  [My Oracle Support](https://support.oracle.com/portal/)

#### Transition Acceptance

When \<Service Provider\> completes the deliverables as specified in the [Workplan](#workplan) section of this document, a closure session will be scheduled within 1-2 weeks to recap the project and to hand it over to the accepting party. In the case of this project, the accepting party is \<Customer Name\>. \<Customer Name\> is now responsible for the OCI tenancy.

From this moment forward, the Oracle \<Service Provider\> team will fully remove their access from your OCI tenancy and provide the access credentials to the accepting party. This marks the completion of the \<Service Provider\> project. There is no sign-off signature required.

## Security Guidelines

### Oracle Security, Identity, and Compliance

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is designed to protect customer workloads with a security-first approach across compute, network, and storage – down to the hardware. It’s complemented by essential security services to provide the required levels of security for your most business-critical workloads.

-   [Security Strategy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/security-strategy.htm) – To create a successful security strategy and architecture for your deployments on OCI, it's helpful to understand Oracle's security principles and the OCI security services landscape.
-   The [security pillar capabilities](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/security.htm#capabilities) reflect fundamental security principles for architecture, deployment, and maintenance. The best practices in the security pillar, help your organization to define a secure cloud architecture, identify and implement the right security controls, and monitor and prevent issues such as configuration drift.

#### References

-   The Best Practices Framework for OCI provides architectural guidance about how to build OCI services in a secure fashion, based on recommendations in the [Best practices framework for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-best-practices).
-   Learn more about [Oracle Cloud Security Practices](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/cloud/).

### Compliance and Regulations

Cloud computing is fundamentally different from traditionally on-premises computing. In the traditional model, organizations are typically in full control of their technology infrastructure located on-premises (e.g., physical control of the hardware, and full control over the technology stack in production). In the cloud, organizations leverage resources and practices that are under the control of the cloud service provider, while still retaining some control and responsibility over other components of their IT solution. As a result, managing security and privacy in the cloud is often a shared responsibility between the cloud customer and the cloud service provider. The distribution of responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the customer also varies based on the nature of the cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
