# Full Stack Disaster Recovery

Full Stack Disaster Recovery is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) disaster recovery orchestration and management service that provides comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities for all layers of an application stack, including infrastructure, middleware, database, and application.
Using OCI Full Stack DR provides a single pane of glass monitoring and management capability for all disaster recovery needs. Full stack disaster recovery easily integrates Oracle platforms and non-Oracle applications and provides recovery for the entire application stack, instead of recovery of individual components, such as databases or compute instances.
