# WebLogic Discovery

The content of this folder is about WebLogic's workloads _discovery_. The term _discovery_ can include different tasks and activities
depending on the context and the goals of the engagement.  

## Possible Discovery Contexts  

### Lift & Shift to OCI

If we are talking about a _Lift & Shift_ (L&S) project from on-premises to OCI, normally we consider the following activities:

1. Collect information to define the _Current State Architecture_.
2. Assess the workloads' functional requirements.  
3. Assess the migration requirements.
4. Assess the required capacity and evaluate the target sizing.  
5. Define the migration approach.
6. Define a detailed migration plan.


### WebLogic Modernization 

In this case, one of the goals of the project is to modernize the application framework and in particular WebLogic. Most of the previous tasks 
will remain the same, but, now we have also:

1. Define the possible modernization paths and their requirements.
2. Define a detailed modernization proposal.
3. Define a _Future State Architecture_.
4. Define a deployment and adoption plan (possibly a _phased_ one).
