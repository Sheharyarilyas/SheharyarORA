# WebLogic Resources

In this folder, we are making available several useful resources that can be used when deploying, using or configuring WebLogic. Here, we focus on _custom applications_ in the sense that we are not considering WebLogic in the context of _Oracle Fusion Middleware_ applications. In the latter case, the WebLogic deployment must follow
specific rules and best practices as described in detail in the dedicated documentation.

## Content Folders

Currently, we have the following content:

### WebLogic Discovery 

Content material to be used for WebLogic workloads discovery (see [README](weblogic-discovery/README.md)).

### WebLogic on VM

Content material regarding the WebLogic deployment in OCI VMs (see [README](weblogic-on-vm/README.md))


### WebLogic for OKE

Content material regarding the WebLogic deployment as containerized application leveraging OCI _Oracle Engine for Kubernetes_ (OKE) (see [README](weblogic-for-oke/README.md)).


### WebLogic Deployment Utilities
