# 3rd Party and ISV Applications

3rd Party Applications are those applications which are not in house developed by your customer. They bought it from a 3rd Party Application vendor. 3rd Party Applications support business processes and/or more technical processes. Examples are SAP, Tableau, Forgerock, Microsoft Dynamics etc. From a technology point of view 3rd Party Applications are build and deployed on a wide variety of technologies, e.g. Operating Systems like Microsoft Server and various Linux flavours, sometimes they run on-prem on systems like AIX. Also application platforms used vary a lot. We have seen Java/Tomcat/JBoss/Weblogic and other, also PHP, .net and other languages. Also in the area of Databases we encountered a wide variety of technologies ranging from Oracle to Microsoft SQL, to MongoDB, Postgres, Redis (although more a cache), MySQL and many more.

ISV Applications are very similar to the above description of 3rd Party Applications, but the company developing the application is using Oracle technology. Examples are Dassault Enovia, Temenos and Murex.
