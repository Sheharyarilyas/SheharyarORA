## Demo

This demo was designed and delivered to a real customer. It highlights how to setup and use AQ with the PL/SQL API.

In script "001.setup.sql", we setup schemas and queue tables in a 19c Oracle Database, according to what is described in "Demo_slide.pdf".
In script "002.SBS.test_AQ.sql" we will test basic AQ functionalities (enqueue and dequeue based on the rules described in "Demo_slide.pdf").
In script "003.SBS.test_queue_propagation.sql" we will test queue propagation.
