# Database23c

By definition, a converged database is a database that provides native support for all modern data types and the latest development paradigms built into one product. By integrating new data types, workloads, and paradigms as features within a converged database, you can support mixed workloads and data types in a much simpler way. You don't need to manage and maintain multiple systems or worry about having to provide unified security across them. 

The Oracle Converged Database makes it easier and faster to develop data-driven apps while maintaining Enterprise-grade capabilities at the same time.
