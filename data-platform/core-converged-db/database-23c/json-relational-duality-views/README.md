# Json relational duality views

Json relational duality views give an abstraction layer on top of your data model.
On top of a relational data model, you define json relational duality views, that give a "document like" view of the data.
Beyond that, you can modify the data through the JRD view, just as if you were updating a JSON document .... and the relational data model is transparently updated.
Reversely, if you update your relational data model, the JSON representation is updated too, and the changes are made visible through the JRD view.
