# Workshops 
This section offers hands-on-workshops that you can use to familizarize with some of the features and capabilities present in the Converged Database.  

## Converged Database Workshop

With the Oracle Converged Database you no longer need multiple single purpose databases for each data type. Oracle has created a single home for relational, JSON, geospatial data and graph databases, offering developers the opportunity to write applications to one data store. 

- Topics
 
    What is a Converged Database?
    Using data types beyond relational data in the Oracle Database.
    JSON in the Oracle Database. 
    Oracle Rest Data Services. 

## Maximum Performance for JSON in the Oracle Database 
 
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data transfer format. It's the de facto standard for document exchange. Oracle Database  offers powerful functionality that makes very easy to store and manage JSON documents.

- Topics

   Storing, querying, and indexing JSON Documents.
   Creating a Partitioned JSON Table.
   Populating the In-Memory Column store with JSON.
   Fast ingest data for JSON documents.


## Oracle Sharding Workshop

  
Oracle Sharding provides superior run-time performance and simpler life-cycle management compared to noSQL databases using a similar approach to scalability. It also provides all the advantages of the Oracle Converged database, supporting complex data types, advanced security, compression, high-availability, developer agility with JSON, and much more.

- Topics

What is Oracle Sharding? 
Deploy a Sharded database. 
Migrate to Sharded database. 
Database requests routing to Shards.  
Sharded database dynamic scaling.
