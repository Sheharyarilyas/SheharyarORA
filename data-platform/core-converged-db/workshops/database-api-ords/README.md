# Database API Workshop

Oracle Rest Data Services (ORDS) is nowadays well known for leveraging Data APIfication. By creating REST endpoints on top of the data (tables, views,collections), or by directly mapping REST endpoints to SQL sentences, Oracle customers are able to build application that access to the database through REST API.
But ORDS also provides hundreds of REST Endpoints for database lifecycle management: using REST URL, customers can manage their PDB lifecycle, and even build a complete database provisioning and monitoring portal. 

Build on a 23c free databases on a Docker container, this workshop gives an excellent pratical experience on the following topics:

- PDB lifecycle management with ORDS: create, clone, unplug/plug, drop PDB with REST endpoints
- Data APIfication with ORDS
- Collections APIfication with SODA for REST

This content is meant to be delivered either as a demo or a workshop in 1h00, a 15mn introduction and 45mn Hands-on-Lab.
