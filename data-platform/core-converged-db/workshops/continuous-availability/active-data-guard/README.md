# Active Data Guard Workshop

The Active Data Guard option is the complement to RAC, adressing Disaster Recovery requirements.
Transparent Application Continuity will protect your application in Active Data Guard scenarios. Along with that, the Fast Start Failover (FSFO) feature allows to build robust architectures, where the decision to fail over another location is delegated to the database itself. Fail over will occur automatically under certain configurable circumstances, leveraging unattended disaster recovery at database level.
This workshops gives very useful practical knowledge about managing an Active Data Guard configuration for continuous availability, taking advantage of the newest features like Transparent Application Continuity (TAC), or the not so new but often not well known features like Fast Start Failover. Build on a 19c database on DBCS, with 3 21c obervers on IaaS, it gives an excellent pratical experience on the following topics:

- Configure and use Data Guard Broker
- Demonstrate Transparent Application Continuity Active Data Guard
- Create a Fast Start Failover configuration with a primary database, an active standby database and 3 observers
- Resilience tests with FSFO and observers

This content is meant to be delivered as a workshop in 3h, a 30mn introduction and 2h30 Hands-on-Lab.
