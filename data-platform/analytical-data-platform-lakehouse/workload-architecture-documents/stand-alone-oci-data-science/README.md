# Stand-alone Data Science - Solution Definition

This repository contains a Machine Learning project based on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science service, reference architecture, useful links, and a workload deployment template. The intent is to equip the Partner/Managed Service Provider/Consultant with the necessary tools and resources so that they can confidently lift and shift or migrate or deploy a green field Machine Learning project into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The document covers : 

- data refinery with OCI Data Integration,
- data warehousing with the Autonomous Data Warehouse,
- data stagging layer with OCI Object Storage,
- analytics with Oracle Analytics Cloud,
- and data science with OCI Data Science.

__Note:__ This is a living document. We will make changes and enhance this as and when needed.  

## When to use this asset?

Any Oracle Partner/Service Provider/Consultant working on a data platform that includes an OCI Data Science project deployment to OCI should find this useful. 

## Instructions for utilizing this asset

We recommend that you use the current 'stand-alone-data-science' as a template for any green field or migration project. This architecture document showcases the best practices. It includes the source 'Draw.IO' file which includes all the diagrams specified in the document as well as some additional diagrams which you might find useful. We have provided the DRAW.IO file so that you can use them as design patterns and modify them as per your project requirements.

## Conclusion

We hope that you will find the architecture document to be a helpful guide for any data platform which includes data science aspects with an OCI Data Science and data platform project. We encourage everyone to provide feedback so that we can further improve our assets.
