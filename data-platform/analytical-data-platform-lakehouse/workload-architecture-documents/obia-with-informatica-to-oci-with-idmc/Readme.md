This repository contains an in-depth guide on how to define and design a Data Warehouse Analytical workload when migrating from an Oracle BI Applications (OBIA) with Informatica Powercenter to Oracle OCI with Informatica IDMC, Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) and Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)

## When to use this asset?

Use this asset when planning a migration of OBIA with Informatica Powercenter to Oracle OCI with OAC and ADW + OBIEE workload as a starting point to an OAC and ADW.

## Instructions for Utilizing This Asset

Use this document as a starting point for the solution definition of an OBIA with Informatica Powercenter migration to OCI with OAC, IDMC and ADW implementation project.

This asset contains sample content for defining a project to deploy the workload and it is just an example and should be used as such. Project scope, timelines, and deliverables will always need to be defined and agreed upon with the Customer on a case-by-case basis.

This asset includes example architecture diagrams for DrawIO in the [files/images subdirectory](files/images).

## Conclusion

The Oracle Database and OBIEE migration to Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Analytics Cloud Solution Definition is expected to serve as a leading guide to the project.

All participants are encouraged to provide feedback, raise queries, and contribute to enhance the overall project's success.
