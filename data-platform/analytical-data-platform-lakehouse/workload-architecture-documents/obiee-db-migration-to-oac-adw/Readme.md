# Oracle Database and OBIEE migration to Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Analytics Cloud

This repository contains an in-depth guide on how to define, design and deploy a Data Warehouse Analytical workload when migrating from an on-premise OBIEE and Oracle database solution to an OCI Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) + Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) solution

## When to use this asset?

Use this asset when planning a migration of Oracle DB + OBIEE workload as a starting point to an OAC and ADW.

## Instructions for Utilizing This Asset

Use this document as a starting point for the solution definition of an ADW and OAC migration implementation project.

This asset contains sample content for defining a project to deploy the workload and it is just an example and should be used as such. Project scope, timelines, and deliverables will always need to be defined and agreed upon with the Customer on a case-by-case basis.

This asset includes example architecture diagrams for DrawIO in the [files/images subdirectory](files/images).

In this Solution definition you will find content in the architecture related to another cloud provider but this can be an on premise situation as well.

## Conclusion

The Oracle Database and OBIEE migration to Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Analytics Cloud Solution Definition is expected to serve as a definitive guide to the project.

All participants are encouraged to provide feedback, raise queries, and contribute to enhance the overall project's success.
