# In-database Machine Learning - Solution Definition

This repository contains a Machine Learning project based on the Autonomous Database Oracle Machine Learning (OML) reference architecture, useful links, and a workload deployment template. The intent is to equip the Partner/Managed Service Provider/Consultant with the necessary tools and resources so that they can confidently lift and shift or migrate or deploy a green field Machine Learning project into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Autonomous Database. The document covers :

- data replication with GoldenGate,
- data refinery with OCI Data Integration,
- data warehousing with the Autonomous Data Warehouse,
- analytics with Oracle Analytics Cloud,
- and data science with Oracle Machine Learning.

__Note:__ This is a living document. We will make changes and enhance this as and when needed.  

## When to use this asset?

Any Oracle Partner/Service Provider/Consultant working on a data platform which includes an Oracle Machine Learning project deployment to OCI should find this useful.

## Instructions for utilizing this asset

We recommend that you use the 'In-database Machine Learning' as a template for any green field or migration project. This architecture document showcases the best practices. It includes the source 'Draw.IO' file which includes all the diagrams specified in the document as well as some additional diagrams which you might find useful. We have provided the DRAW.IO file so that you can use them as design patterns and modify them as per your project requirements.

## Conclusion

We hope that you will find the architecture document to be a helpful guide for any data platform which includes a data science aspects with an Oracle Machine Learning project. We encourage everyone to provide feedback so that we can further improve our assets.

### Useful Links
This workload uses OCI services that are part of the Oracle Data platform and it can be further augmented with additional services and capabilities that are described on the [Data platform - data lakehouse reference architecture](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/data-platform-lakehouse/index.html#GUID-A328ACEF-30B8-4595-B86F-F27B512744DF).
